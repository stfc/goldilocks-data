# Plan: Create an Issue

Plan: **$ARGUMENTS**

Create a structured plan as a GitHub Issue. The issue body serves as the plan document — it persists across sessions, is searchable, and can be referenced by PRs.

## Planning Principles

**Keep plans proportional to the task.** A quick fix needs a short issue. A multi-phase refactor needs phases, tasks, and acceptance criteria. Match the plan's weight to the work's complexity.

**Specify direction, not line numbers.** Identify files and describe what changes. Include draft code for key interfaces and non-obvious logic — real code that conveys the design.

**Plans are for orientation, not control.** A good plan helps the implementer understand *what* to build and *why*, then gets out of the way.

## Planning Process

1. **Research** — explore the codebase to understand current structure and constraints
2. **Design** — define scope, goals, and key decisions
3. **Write** — create a GitHub Issue with the plan
4. **Track** — keep the issue body current when the plan changes; use comments/PR links for progress, reviews, verification, and handoff history

## Issue Templates

### Lightweight (single-session work)

```markdown
## Problem
What's wrong or what's needed. Specific.

## Approach
How to tackle it. Files to touch, key changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [testable condition]
- [ ] [testable condition]

---
Written by an agent on behalf of <user>.
```

```bash
gh issue create --title "feat: short description" --body-file plan.md
```

### Full (multi-phase work)

```markdown
## Problem
What's wrong or what's needed. Why it matters.

## Goals
- Goal 1
- Goal 2

## Non-Goals
- What this plan explicitly does NOT address.

## Approach
High-level design decisions and rationale.
Include draft code for key interfaces.

## Phases

### Phase 1: [Name]
**Goal:** What this phase accomplishes

Tasks:
- [ ] P1-T1: Description
- [ ] P1-T2: Description

Verification: How to check this phase is complete.

### Phase 2: [Name]
(repeat)

## Open Questions
- Question 1?
- Question 2?

---
Written by an agent on behalf of <user>.
```

```bash
gh issue create --title "feat: short description" --body-file plan.md
```

## After Creating

1. Summarize the plan for the user
2. Ask whether to proceed with implementation or refine the plan
3. As phases complete, update checklist state in the issue body if that checklist is the active tracker
4. Add progress, review results, verification output, and handoff notes as comments
5. Link the issue from follow-up PRs and reports so the thread remains the durable record

## Gotchas

- Every issue body created by an agent must include `Written by an agent on behalf of <user>.`, replacing `<user>` with the human who requested the work.
- Don't over-plan simple tasks — a 3-line issue for a typo fix is worse than just fixing it
- Update the issue body as understanding evolves, but do not edit it for routine status notes
- If the plan changes significantly, edit the issue — stale plans mislead future sessions
- If you are adding historical context rather than changing the current plan, comment instead
